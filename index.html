                These days, and for the next 10+ years, I'm building <a href="#" class="highlight-link" data-description="Ando is a messaging platform for teams using lots of agents. We're obsessed with helping people do more with their words. Come join us. <a href='https://www.ando.so' class='description-link'>www.ando.so</a>">Ando</a> - Slack that works better for humans <em>*and*</em> agents. Previously, I cofounded <a href="#" class="highlight-link" data-description="Alloy is an iPaaS used by Amazon, Best Buy, Typeform, & other enterprises. We're backed by $27M in funding from a16z, Bain Capital Ventures, Shopify, YC, & others. I started it in 2019 because I wanted a better no code automation platform. <a href='https://www.runalloy.com' class='description-link'>www.runalloy.com</a>">Alloy</a>, which I'm now involved with as a board member.

                In my spare time, I explore the web, read about language theory, and study technology more broadly - history, market currents, and emerging research.

                I'm a self-taught engineer but I'm naturally a much stronger designer, so that's what I practice these days. Either way, I'm happiest when I get to work with other builders to realize ambitious projects.
