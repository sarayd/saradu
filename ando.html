                Ando is a messaging platform for teams that want to get more done with agents. I named the company after my favorite architect, as a lot of the work we're doing requires us to take a similar approach & design philosophy. We draw a lot of our inspiration from architecture, in addition to music and linguistics.  Ultimately, we’re obsessed with helping people do more with their words.
